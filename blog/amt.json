This division encompassed the woodshop, machinist shop, and laser cutter studio. 'Dirty Fab' was named in contrast to 'Clean Fab,' which focused on 2D/3D printing and electronics fabrication. My role involved maintaining equipment, supporting classes, improving workshop accessibility, and mentoring members in fabrication techniques."
