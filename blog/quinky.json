This includes evaluating existing commerce and content platforms to understand their feature sets, limitations, and user experiences. Special attention is being given to open-source and headless CMS solutions, as well as monetization flows. Prototyping will leverage NextJS for its performance benefits, extensibility, and compatibility with modern deployment workflows. The goal is to establish a scalable, modular foundation that supports rapid iteration and future growth."
